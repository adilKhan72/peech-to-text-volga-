    """The function an rq worker actually runs for a queued job.

    Permanent failures (UnsupportedAudioError) are marked failed and never re-raised,
    so RQ's Retry never fires for them — retrying a corrupted file forever wastes
    compute and hides a problem that needs a different input, not another attempt.

    Anything else is treated as transient: re-raised so RQ's own Retry/backoff
    schedules another attempt. We only flip the DB row to FAILED ourselves once we can
    see (via retries_left) that this was the last attempt — RQ's on_failure callback
    fires on every attempt, not just the final one, so we check this explicitly
    instead of relying on it.
